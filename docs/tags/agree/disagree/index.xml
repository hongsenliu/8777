      <description>Some people say that we no longer need printed newspaper, do you agree or disagree? In the present era, newspapers have become less popular, so it is argued thatthey will disappear. I strongly agree withthis opinion.
The main reason is thatthere are many better alternatives, which reduces the value of newspapers to us. Nowadays, news media websites and mobile applications can not only inform us of the latest affairs around the world but the information is presented in multimodal ways such as video and audio, providing audience with a more engaging reading expericnce than printed media.</description>
